üß† Advanced Calculations

Strike Rate Category (Using LOOKUPVALUE() to group players)

Ranking (Using RANKX() with ALL() to avoid filter context)

Deviation of Runs:= ABS(SUM(Batting[Runs]) - AVERAGE(Batting[Runs]))
Squared Deviation:= POWER(SUM(Batting[Runs]) - AVERAGE(Batting[Runs]), 2)


‚ö† Note on Zero Values

Some data fields like Stumpings or 5-Wicket hauls may contain zeros. These represent non-applicable metrics for the specific player and are excluded from average calculations.
